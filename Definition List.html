<h2>Definition Lists</h2>

<h3>Rationale</h3>

<p>Here are two reasons to support definition lists:</p>

<ul>
<li>Documenting command line switches, and</li>
<li>Documenting function call arguments.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course there are probably other reasons as well.</p>

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The following demonstrates the syntax of the definition list:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Term</dt>
<dd><p>Definition.</p></dd>
<dt>Definition Marker</dt>
<dd><p>The definition marker is the colon (<code>:</code>), followed by the 
equals symbol (<code>=</code>).  This delimiter was chosen because it is the mathematical
symbol for definition and is, in all likelihood, an uncommon symbol in the 
vast amount of markdown in the ether, hence making this addition, for <em>most</em> 
markdown, backwards compatible.</p></dd>
<dt>Terms &amp; Definitions</dt>
<dd><p>Terms and definitions may have multiple words, and definitions may carry onto 
subsequent lines.  The term is anything before the definition marker on a line,
while the definition is anything after the marker that ends in two newlines 
followed by either a new term (which is a line with a definition marker) or a 
non-indented string.  </p>

<p>Note that with this specification, terms must be a single line, while 
definitions may have multiple paragraphs.  And like ordered and unordered lists, 
definitions that have multiple paragraphs need only to have the first line of 
the paragraph indented.</p>

<p>Two other things to note are that:</p>

<ol>
<li>the first paragraph of the definition can be separated from the term one or 
two newlines if that's clearer; and</li>
<li>definitions may also have embedded lists.</li>
</ol></dd>
</dl>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Command Line Switches</h3>

<p>The following are some options from the <code>ls</code> command:</p>

<dl>
<dt>-a, --all</dt>
<dd><p>do not ignore entries with .</p></dd>
<dt>-A, --almost-all</dt>
<dd><p>do not list implied . and ..</p></dd>
<dt>--author</dt>
<dd><p>with -l, print the author of each file</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3>Function Arguments</h3>

<p>The following are the arguments to the C <code>main</code> function :</p>

<dl>
<dt>int argc</dt>
<dd><p>the number of command line arguments</p></dd>
<dt>char **argv</dt>
<dd><p>the list of command line arguments</p></dd>
</dl>
